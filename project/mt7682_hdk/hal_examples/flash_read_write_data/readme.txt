@par Overview
  - Example description
    - This example is a reference application to erase, read and write data
      from/to the flash.
    - This example does not require FreeRTOS.
  - Results
    - The transaction output is collected in a log.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported platform
    - LinkIt 7682 HDK.
  - HDK switches and pin configuration
    - N/A.
  - Environment configuration
    - The output logs are communicated through a type-A to micro-B USB cable
      to the PC from MK20 USB connector on the HDK.
    - Install the mbed serial driver according to the instructions at
      https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration. For
      more information, please refer to section "Installing the LinkIt 7682
      HDK drivers on Microsoft Windows" on the "LinkIt 7682 HDK User Guide"
      in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - Use a type-A to micro-B USB cable to connect type-A USB of the PC and
      MK20 micro-B USB connector on the LinkIt 7682 HDK. For more information
      about the connector cable, please refer to
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors.
    - Launch a terminal emulator program, such as Tera terminal on your PC
      for data logging through UART. For the installation details, please
      refer to section "Installing Tera terminal on Microsoft Windows" on the
      "Airoha IoT SDK for RTOS Get Started Guide" in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data: 8 bits, stop bit: 1, parity:
      none and flow control: off.

@par Run the example
  - Build the project with a command "./build.sh mt7682_hdk
    flash_read_write_data bl" from the SDK root folder and download the
    binary file to LinkIt 7682 HDK.
  - Connect the HDK to the PC with a type-A to micro-B USB cable and specify
    the port on Tera terminal corresponding to "mbed Serial Port".
  - Run the example. The result is displayed in the log and "Flash example is
    successful!" indicates a successful operation.
