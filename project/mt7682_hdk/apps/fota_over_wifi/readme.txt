@par Overview
  - Example project description
    - This example demonstrates the basic workflow of full binary FOTA
      update, including how to use Wi-Fi to download FOTA package based on 
      the LinkIt 7682 HDK through the following:
      - How to use the Wi-Fi profile settings stored in the NVDM to initialize
        the Wi-Fi.
      - How to use CLI command to operate FOTA process.
  - Application features
    - Act as a Wi-Fi station to connect to a Wi-Fi network.
    - Use CLI command to trigger FOTA download and update process.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported platform
    - MediaTek LinkIt 7682 HDK.
  - HDK switches and pin configuration
    - J36 provides the pins for GPIOs, PWMs, SPI master chip select 0, SPI
      master, UART1 RX/TX.
    - J35 provides the pins for GPIOs, PWMs, UART2 RX/TX, UART1 RTS/CTS, SPI
      master chip select 1, IR TX and IR RX.
    - J34 provides the pins for GPIOs, PWMs, UART2 RTS/CTS, I2S, SPI slave, and
      I2C0.
    - J33 provides the pins for GPIOs, PWMs, I2C0, ADC0~3.
    - J32 provides the pins for GND, 5V, 3.3V and reset pin.
    - J25 set the HDK to either Flash Normal mode or Flash Recovery mode.
      To update the firmware on the LinkIt 7682 HDK:
       - Set the jumper J25 to FLASH Recovery mode, the jumpers J23, J26, J27
         and J30 should be on.
       - In this mode, if the power is on, the board will load ROM code and start
         the ATE Daemon or Firmware Upgrade Daemon 
         according to the MT76x7 Flash Toolâ€™s behavior on the PC.
      To run the project on the LinkIt 7682 HDK:
       - Set the jumper J25 off to switch to FLASH Normal mode, the jumpers J23,
         J26, J27 and J30 should be on.
       - In this mode, if the power is on, the board will load firmware from the
         flash and reboot.
    - There are three buttons on the board:
      - RST - reset.
      - EINT - external interrupt trigger.
      - RTC_INT - RTC interrupt trigger.
  - Environment configuration
    - A serial tool is required, such as hyper terminal or TeraTerm for UART
      logging.
    - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1, parity:
      none and flow control: off.

@par Run the examples
  - Connect the board to a PC with a USB cable.
  - Build the example project and download the binary file to the LinkIt
    7682 HDK.
  - Reboot the HDK, the console will show "FreeRTOS Running" message to
    indicate the HDK is booting up.
  - Use '?' and enter to query the available command line options.
    Note that the command line options are still under development and subject
    to change without notice.
  - Use below command to connect to Wi-Fi access point.
    wifi config set ssid 0 ap_name
    wifi config set psk 0 password
    wifi config set reload
  - After ip address retrieved and shown in log, the connection has been established.
  - Use below command to trigger FOTA download:
    fota httpdl url
    e.g. fota httpdl http://192.168.0.198/image.bin
  - Then the downloading process will be shown in log.
  - After download finished, please input this command to trigger update.
    fota go
    reboot
  - Then device will reboot and enter bootloader phase, bootloader will enter FOTA update flow.
  - Notice: if use IAR compiler, the built out binary is a combination of bootloader, RTOS and PwrTX.
    So user should use extract_rtos_bin.py to get the actual rtos binary file from the iar image, and
    then use rtos binary to generate FOTA package by FOTA packaging tool.
